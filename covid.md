My fellow Singaporeans,

Our fight against COVID-19 has reached a **major turning point**. We will be making a decisive move towards living with COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) will announce the changes after this broadcast. But let me set the context: Take stock of our journey thus far; and explain our plans moving forward.


We have battled COVID-19 for more than two years now. Right from the start, we had one overriding aim: to protect lives, and prevent as many avoidable deaths as possible. We saw in other countries bleak images of people desperately seeking admission into hospitals, and healthcare workers being forced to choose who lived and who died. We were determined to prevent that happening here, and fortunately we have managed to do so. Our healthcare system came under strain, but it was not overwhelmed. We ensured enough ICU beds and oxygen for everyone who needed them. We recorded one of the lowest rates of COVID-19 related deaths in the world.

This has been a tough fight. With each new wave, we had to move quickly and adapt. Every time we thought we had the pandemic under control, the virus surprised us. In the early stages, when little was known about the virus, we adopted stringent measures. Our measures kept community cases very low, and helped us to control and clear a major outbreak in our migrant worker dormitories. We bought time to ramp up our healthcare capacity and roll out a comprehensive national vaccination programme.

Then the more dangerous Delta variant struck. Thankfully, by then our vaccination programme was in full swing. But we kept strict measures in place to slow the spread of the virus, until we had vaccinated nearly everyone eligible, especially the elderly. Meanwhile, we changed our health protocols to allow mild cases to recover safely at home, relieving the load on our healthcare system. When we eased up on Safe Management Measures, we had a large wave of COVID-19 cases. But by then most Singaporeans had been vaccinated, and were well protected from the Delta variant. Still, many patients had to be hospitalised, and some unfortunately succumbed to the virus.

Not too long after the Delta wave subsided, the virus threw us another curveball – this time the even more infectious Omicron variant. We braced ourselves as countries across the world saw record-high cases. Our numbers went up sharply too, at the peak exceeding 25,000 in a single day. With our high vaccination rate and strong healthcare system, we were quietly confident we could cope. Still, we tightened our border measures and held back easing our SMMs, to give our healthcare system and workers time to respond.

We were relieved that Omicron turned out less severe than earlier variants, and that relatively few cases were serious enough to need oxygen support or ICU care. Over the last two weeks, daily new cases have been coming down. Week on week, the ratio is now around 0.8. At this rate, the number of daily infections will halve in about three weeks


We only achieved this through everyone’s collective effort. You understood the mission and did your part — **trusted the government**, accepted sound medical advice, abided by Safe Management Measures patiently and responsibly, got yourself and your loved ones vaccinated, organised yourselves to help one another, and self-tested with ART kits, and self-isolated if you tested positive.

Businesses and essential workers also did their part, to keep our economy and social services going. They adapted repeatedly to changing SMMs. They coped with supply chain and manpower disruptions, and stayed resilient despite formidable difficulties, especially in the hard-hit sectors. Thank you for your grit and resourcefulness, you helped us protect Singaporeans’ livelihoods, and prepared ourselves to emerge stronger from the pandemic.

Most of all, I want to thank our healthcare workers. You made tremendous sacrifices, at a heavy personal cost. Pulling long shifts, day after day, week after week, since the start of the pandemic, returning to work on rest days to cover for colleagues who caught the virus, putting up with all the safety measures at the hospitals, and risking exposure as you cared for infected patients. Because of you, we have maintained some semblance of normalcy in the past two years. Some countries have seen mass resignations of healthcare workers. But our healthcare team, doctors and nurses stayed at their posts and kept on performing their duties. So to our healthcare and frontline workers, from the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say: Thank you!


To our healthcare and frontline workers, **from the bottom of my heart**, and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say: Thank you!


Now, we have **reached a major milestone** in our COVID-19 journey. The **overwhelming majority** of our population is **fully vaccinated**, and nearly everyone eligible has received a booster shot. The Omicron wave has crested, and is now subsiding. With many of us already exposed to the virus and recovered, our population has stronger immunity. Crucially, our healthcare system remains resilient. It was under considerable stress at the peak of the Omicron wave, but it held up. The load is still heavy, but the pressure is now easing.

In judging how far and fast to ease restrictions, we are very mindful not to stress our healthcare workers and system to breaking point. We must not place an impossible burden on the healthcare workers, and endanger many COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who urgently need treatment. At the same time, we must weigh the cost of stringent SMMs on businesses and the economy, and their impact on children needing to learn, youths yearning to interact, families seeking to bond, and communities striving to connect. Taking all things into consideration, we believe that we are now ready to take a decisive step forward towards living with COVID-19.

We will make the following changes to our SMMs. First, we will double the group size from the current 5 persons, to 10 persons. Second, we will allow up to 75% of employees who can work from home to return to their workplaces. Third, we will increase the capacity limit for larger events and settings (those with more than 1,000 people) to 75%. Fourth, wearing masks outdoors will now be optional. This is because the risk of outdoor transmission is significantly lower, but indoors, masks will still be mandatory. Finally, we will maintain safe distancing requirements for now – one meter between groups where masks are off, to minimise transmission in mask-off settings. These changes will come into effect next Tuesday, 29 March.

**Concurrently**, we will ease up cross-border travel substantially. Earlier, we were cautious because of uncertainty over Omicron’s impact. Now the Omicron situation is well under control. Nearly all our cases are domestic, originating within the community. Arrivals from abroad constitute only a very small proportion of cases. We can therefore safely open up our borders. We will drastically streamline testing and quarantine requirements for travellers. This simplified Vaccinated Travel Framework will let Singaporeans travel abroad more easily – almost like before COVID-19. It will also lift most restrictions for fully vaccinated visitors entering Singapore. This will reconnect Singapore with the world. It will give a much-needed boost to businesses, particularly the tourism sector. And help Singapore reclaim its position as a business and aviation hub. The MTF will provide the details.

These domestic and cross-border changes represent a major step towards living with COVID-19, but they stop short of a complete opening up. We remain watchful because COVID-19 may yet bring further surprises. Some countries have taken a ‘Freedom Day’ approach. They have declared the pandemic over, relaxed all restrictions at once. Now they are anxiously watching their infection and mortality numbers rising rapidly again. We are choosing to maintain our measured approach, which has served us well over the past two years. After this major step, we will wait a while to let the situation stabilise. If all goes well, we will ease up further. But we should also be psychologically prepared for more twists and turns ahead. With more interactions, we too may see another wave of cases, and Omicron will not be the last variant we encounter. The virus will continue to evolve. Hopefully, new variants will become progressively milder and more flu-like. But it is also possible that more aggressive and dangerous mutants will turn up, just like Delta did. If that happens, we may have to backtrack and tighten up our restrictions again. We cannot rule this out, even though we hope it will not be necessary. But whatever happens, we now have the knowledge and the means to keep everyone safe. For example, giving everyone another booster jab, or administering an updated vaccine, if necessary.

So please take today’s announcements in the right spirit. Resume more normal lives, enjoy larger gatherings of family and friends, go outdoors without masks, or reunite with loved ones abroad. But do not throw all caution to the wind. Each one of us must still play our part. Comply with the revised SMMs. If you feel ill, test yourself. If you test positive, isolate yourself at home; If you test negative, and decide to go out, please wear a mask to protect others, even outdoors, just in case. Let us all continue to exercise personal and social responsibility — to keep ourselves well, to keep others safe, and to avoid adding to the burden on our healthcare workers. That way, even when new problems arise, we stand a much better chance of keeping things under control and staying on the path to a new normal.


We have **come a long way** in our fight against COVID-19. We are not yet at the finish line, though we are getting closer. Key to our response has been the trust that Singaporeans have placed in your government, in the medical authorities, and in each other. Throughout our journey, we have kept faith and supported one another. This solidarity remains crucial as we tackle fresh challenges ahead. I thank everyone for your continued trust and support. Let us keep it up, and see through this pandemic as one united people.

Thank you!



 

【李显龙总理全国讲话】冠状病毒-19: 迈入新阶段
2022年3月24日
各位同胞

我国与冠病疫情的对抗，已经进入重要转折点。接下来，我们将果断地迈向与冠病共存。政府抗疫跨部门工作小组将在我发表全国讲话后，宣布相关的调整。但我想先告诉大家有关的背景情况，回顾我国的抗疫历程，并说明政府接下来的计划。

新加坡的抗疫历程
新加坡对抗冠病的战役，至今已持续两年多。从一开始，我们最重要的目标就是保护生命，以及把可避免的死亡病例降到最低。当时，我们看到一些国家情况严峻，病患迫切需要入院治疗。医护人员被迫决定该救谁和不救谁。我们坚决不让新加坡发生这样的情况，而我们做到了。虽然我国医疗系统面临压力，但还是能够应付疫情。我们确保了医院有足够的加护病房床位和氧气供应，治疗每一位有需要的病人。我国是冠病死亡率最低的国家之一。

这是一场硬仗。每次出现新一波疫情，我们都要迅速应对。每当我们以为情况已受控时，疫情又出现意料不到的演变。疫情初期，由于对病毒了解不多，我们采取了严格的防疫措施。这些措施使得社区病例非常少，并有助于我国控制并稳定客工宿舍暴发的疫情。此外，我们也争取到时间提升医疗系统的应对能力和全面推行全国疫苗接种计划。

接着，更危险的德尔塔变种毒株来袭。幸好，我们当时已全面展开疫苗接种计划。但我们继续实施严格的防疫措施以减缓病毒的传播速度，直到几乎所有符合条件的人，尤其是年长人士都完成疫苗接种。与此同时，我们调整了冠病医疗方案，让轻症患者能安全地在家休养，以减轻医疗系统的负担。在放宽了安全管理措施之后，冠病患者却大幅度增加。然而，当时大多数的国人已经接种了疫苗，能有效地抵抗德尔塔毒株。可是，许多病患还是得住院，当中一些人也不幸逝世。

德尔塔疫情消退不久，我们又遇到难题，这回来袭的是更具传染性的奥密克戎变种毒株。我们严阵以待，全球各地的确诊人数则不断创新高。新加坡的病例同样激增，单日新增病例曾在最高峰时超过2万5000起。但由于我国的疫苗接种率高，加上医疗系统健全，因此我们还是有信心可以应付疫情。尽管如此，我们还是收紧边境措施，并延后放宽安全管理措施，以让医疗系统和医护人员有足够的时间应对。

我们很庆幸奥密克戎毒株的威力不比之前出现的其他毒株来得强。本地也没有太多需要输氧或入住加护病房的重症病例。过去两个星期，单日新增病例已经有所减少。现在的每周病例增长率约为0.8。如果能保持这样的趋势，单日新增病例大约会在三周内减半。

齐心抗疫的成果
这全靠大家的努力付出，齐心抗疫。你们深明大义，各尽其责，信任政府，听取卫生当局的建议，遵守安全管理措施，保持耐心和负起社会责任。让自己和亲人接种疫苗，群策群力，守望相助。自行做抗原快速检测，一旦结果呈阳性就自我隔离。

企业和提供必要服务的员工也做出贡献，让经济活动和社会服务得以继续。他们一再适应不时改变的安全管理措施，以及应付供应链受干扰和人手短缺的问题。他们在面对巨大困难时，保持坚韧不拔。尤其是那些受重创的行业。因为你们的勇气和毅力，灵活应变，让我们保住了国人的生计，也做好准备，使我国能在后冠病时代变得更强韧。最重要的是，我要感谢我们的医护人员。你们做出了很大的牺牲，付出了巨大的个人代价。日复一日地长时间工作，从疫情初期便是如此。在休息日时回到医院代班，顶替感染冠病的同事。你们配合医院的安全措施。不惜冒着感染风险，尽心照顾冠病患者。因为你们的付出，我们这两年来才能过着接近正常的生活。一些国家有大量的医护人员辞职。但我们的医疗团队、医生和护士始终坚守岗位，把工作做好。所以，我要向我们的医护和前线人员表示感激，我谨代表全国人民由衷地向你们说声谢谢！

成为具冠病韧性的社会
此刻，我国迎来了抗疫历程的一个重要里程碑。本地绝大部分人已完成疫苗接种，几乎所有符合条件的人也打了追加剂。奥密克戎毒株所引发的疫情，已经达到顶峰，开始缓和下来。许多人也曾染病并已经康复，所以我们的群体免疫力更高了。更关键的是，我们的医疗系统始终保持坚韧。尽管它在奥密克戎疫情最严重时，承受相当大的压力，但始终挺过了难关。如今，医院仍旧负担沉重，但面对的压力已有所减轻。

在决定多快放宽限制，放宽多少的时候，我们深知不能让医护人员和医疗系统所承受的压力达到极限。我们不能让医护人员负担过重，这会使到急需治疗的冠病和非冠病患者面临危险。同时我们也必须衡量严格的防疫措施对企业和经济所造成的代价，以及对孩子们的学习，或是年轻人、家人和社群之间的互动交流所带来的影响。在考虑了所有因素后，我们相信我国已经做好准备，能够果断地迈向与冠病共存

所以，我们将调整安全管理措施：第一，我们会放宽聚会人数限制，从现在的5人增加到10人。第二，我们将允许多达75%的居家办公者，重返工作场所上班。第三，我们将放宽大型活动和场所的容量限制，（人数超过1000人时）容量可高达75%。第四，人们在户外时可以选择不戴口罩。这是因为，病毒在户外传播的风险比在室内低许多。不过，人们在室内还是必须戴口罩。最后，安全距离规定则暂时不变。只要是没有戴口罩，人们就必须保持一米的安全距离，以把传播风险降到最低。这些措施将在下星期二，也就是3月29日生效。

与此同时，我们也会大幅度放宽跨境旅游限制。之前，我们一直谨慎行事，因为我们不知道奥密克戎毒株会带来什么样的冲击。如今，奥密克戎疫情已受到控制。几乎所有病例属于境内感染，病源来自社区，而境外输入的病例只占很少数。因此，我们可以安全地开放边境。我国也将大大地简化旅客做检测和隔离的相关规定。简化的疫苗接种者旅游框架将更方便国人出国，和疫情前几乎一样。我们也会放宽大多数的限制，让已完成疫苗接种的旅客在入境新加坡时更方便。这将让新加坡重新和世界各地连接起来，为企业注入一剂强心针，尤其能提振旅游业，并有助于新加坡恢复商业及航空枢纽的地位。政府抗疫跨部门工作小组将提供有关细节。

这些有关国内防疫措施和跨境旅游限制的改变，意味着我们正在大步迈向与冠病共存。不过，这不等于全面放宽所有限制。我们保持警惕，因为冠病疫情可能还会有出乎意料的发展。一些国家已采取自由开放的策略，宣告疫情已结束，并全面解封。如今他们正密切关注患病和死亡人数再度飙升的情况。

我们选择继续采取适当的策略，因为过去两年的经历显示这个做法是有效的。在迈出这重大一步后，我们会等待一段时间，让疫情稳定下来。如果情况发展良好，我们将再次放宽限制。但我们也要做好心理准备，未来有可能会遇到更多波折。由于人们有更多互动，我们也可能迎来新一波的疫情。奥密克戎病毒不会是我们面对的最后一个变种毒株。病毒会继续变异。但愿新的变种毒株，其威力会越变越弱，更像流感病毒。但也有可能的是，传染性更强以及更危险的变种毒株会出现，就像德尔塔毒株一样。如果这样的情况发生，我们可能需要倒退，再次收紧防疫措施。我们不能排除这个可能性，即便我们希望它不会发生。无论如何，如今我们已有经验和方法来应对，能保护每个人。例如，政府也许得让人们再接种追加剂，又或者为大家施打新款疫苗。

因此，请大家以正确的心态看待今天的宣布。让生活进一步回归正常，和更多的亲友聚会、在户外无需戴口罩，或与国外亲友团聚。但请不要彻底放松警惕。我们每个人还是必须各尽其责，继续遵守调整后的安全管理措施。身体不适时，就自我检测。如果结果呈阳性，请在家隔离。即便结果呈阴性，请在决定外出时戴口罩保护他人；即使是在户外，也照旧戴着，以防万一。我呼吁大家继续对自己以及对社会负起责任，保护自己，也保护他人的健康，避免加重医护人员的负担。这样，即使出现新的问题，我们也更有把握让情况受到控制。持续稳步向前，以到达新常态。

总结
在这条漫长的抗疫之路，我们取得了很大的进展。我们还没有到达终点，但我们离终点线更近了。我们能沉着应战的关键因素，是国人对政府和卫生当局的信任，以及对彼此的互信。一直以来，我们都互相信任，互相扶持。这股同舟共济、团结一致的精神，在我们日后迎接新挑战时，仍至关重要。我感谢大家继续信任和支持我们。让我们再接再厉，全国上下一心，共同走出疫情。

谢谢。
